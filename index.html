              <h2>About Duan</h2>
              <p>After I graduated from college, I became a Drug Testing technician for people who are under parole and probation. I also enjoyed music producing and learning about creating webpages and software.</p>

              <p>As a student at <strong>Thinkful</strong>, I have begun my jounrney to become a software developer and I could not be more excited! I enjoy working in team settings and feel team work is the best method at achieving goals. One thing I like about the tech industry is that helping each other is encouraged. If you are stuck and need assistance other developers are happy to help.</p>

              <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I am so excited to learn, build, and grow during this new career path.</p>
