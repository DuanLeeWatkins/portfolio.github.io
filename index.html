						<h2>About Me</h2>
					</header>



					<p>While in High school, I was always fascinated with the criminal justice system. I used to love watching the show
					'Criminal Minds'. After High school, I went to college to study criminal justice. When I graduated, I joined a federal
					agency doing testing. In this position, I was a great team player. I was always offering my time to help my supervisor
					or coworkers with tasks or troubleshooting problems. My supervisor would always ask me to do specific duties because she
					could always count on me to complete them promptly. While working for this agency, I always had Penelope, the technical
					analyst from "Criminal Minds" in the back of my mind. She was always helping the agents solve complicated cases with her
					computer skills. I wanted to be like Penelope and use my technical skills to help my team achieve a common goal that
					will help others.</p>
					
					<p>When I did some research on different tech sub-fields, I found an interest in software engineering. So in my free time,
					I began developing my software engineering skills. When the pandemic hit, there was less work to do at my agency which,
					allowed me to focus more on the software engineering skills that I have been developing for some time. I took on some
					personal projects and open sourcing projects that helped me further my skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB,
					Express.js, and Node.js. From what I've learned and created, I enjoyed software engineering which, made me decide to go
					down this career path instead of going back to testing as things open up. I love the front-end aspect of engineering.
					Being able to express my creative side while using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to build
					clean-looking, accessible, easy-to-navigate web interfaces has always been very fulfilling. I like using JavaScript as
					the primary language front-end and back-end of an application/webpage because of its simplicity, speed, popularity, and
					ability to create rich interfaces. Problem-solving has always been one of my exceptional skills. I enjoy the process of
					problem-solving and the euphoric feeling of finding a solution.</p>
					
					<p>I would make a great addition to any team within a company. I am dedicated, trustworthy, highly motivated, a team
					player, dependable, eager to learn more, and passionate to be a part of something great.</p>
